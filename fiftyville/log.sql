/*// look at crime scene report for July 28, 2021, that took place on Humphrey Street 

SELECT description 
FROM crime_scene_reports
WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND year = 2021
AND street = "Humphrey Street";

--> Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery. 
Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€“ each 
of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery.
Littering took place at 16:36. No known witnesses.


ADDTIONAL INFORMATION FROM QUERY:

- theft took place at 10:15 AM on Humphrey Street bakery
- Three witnessed, each interview transcript mentions bakery
	- look at interviews table: SELECT transcript FROM interviews WHERE transcript LIKE "%bakery%";
	- using bottom line to confirm there are 4 transcripts and not 3, messy output in terminal
	- there are 4 transcripts not 3 SELECT COUNT(transcript) FROM interviews WHERE transcript LIKE "%bakery%"; 
	
		- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery 
		  parking lot and drive away. 
		  If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that 
		  left the parking lot in that time frame.
		  
		  	- SELECT activity, hour, minute FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28;
		  	- ALternatively which is better
		  	- SELECT activity, hour, minute ,license_plate FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute < 26 AND minute > 14;
		  	- returns results as entrance or exit | hour | minute
		  	- want to look for an exit at around 10 minutes after or before 10:15 AM

				// only look at license plate for up to 10 minutes after theft

		- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. 
		  Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, 
		  I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
		 
		- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. 
		  In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville 
		  tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
		  
		  	- conflicting details here, did the person get in the car first or go make the phone call?
		  	- check for calls made withing 10 minutes of robbery, need names first though, so look deeper into license plates^^
		  
		- I saw Richard take a bite out of his pastry at the bakery before his pastry was stolen from him.
		
			- look for RICHARD in license plate security logs if he drove
			- Check what time he got there at, to confirm time of the robbery
				- query: SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = "Richard"; 
				         SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE  "Richard"; /I guess this works better in case theres case sensitivity
				- only one richard in the database: 710572|Richard||7894166154|20Q418R
				- check logs
					- SELECT * FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE license_plate = "20Q418R";
		 
- Someone littered at 16:36, but no witnesses
	- look at bakery security logs: 
		SELECT activity 
		FROM bakery_security_logs 
		WHERE month = 7 
		AND day = 28 
		AND year = 2021 
		AND hour = 16
		AND minute = 36;
		// copy paste
		SELECT activity FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 16 AND minute = 36;
